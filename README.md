This is a color scheme for Sublime Text 3 (although I guess it will work for version 2).

Note that this is not a tango theme, but it is heavily inspired by gedit's oblivion theme for Python (hence the name) which is a tango theme.
Notable exceptions from the tango style is the colour of strings, which is a bright and warm yellow, meant to be easy on the eye (or at least mine). And the background which is an almost black, but slightly warm tone.

I mostly use Python, so the schema is at its best there. And while a few other languages works, they mostly work by default.

It is far from perfect, and there is certainly room for improvements and simplifications in the schema, and so far, it's only for my own enjoyment and to highlight code the way I like to.
