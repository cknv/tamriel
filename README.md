This is a Sublime Text 2. Although I would guess it could work with any text editor accepting TextMate themes. 

Note that this is not a tango theme, but it is heavily inspired by gedit's oblivion theme for Python (hence the name) which is a tango theme.
Notable exceptions from the tango style is the colour of strings, which is a bright and warm yellow, meant to be easy on the eye (or at least mine). And the background which is an almost black, but slightly warm tone.

Currently implemented (sane schema):
- Python
- Java
- XML
- Shell
- Jinja2
- CSS

Planned Future Support (only defaults):
- HTML
- Javascript
- SQL

It is far from perfect, and there is certainly room for improvements and simplifications in the schema, and so far, it's only for my own enjoyment and to highlight code the way I like to.
