This is a color scheme for Sublime Text 3 (although I guess it will work for version 2).

Note that this is not an actual tango theme, but as it is inspired by a tango theme (namely gedit for gnome2), it uses a fair share of tango colors.
Notable exceptions from the tango style is the colour of strings, which is a bright and warm yellow, meant to be easy on the eye (or at least mine). And the background which is an almost black, but slightly warm tone.

I mostly use Python, and while I have been trying to keep any special python elements out of the scheme, I cannot promise that the highlighting choices all makes sense.

It is far from perfect, and there is certainly room for improvements and simplifications in the schema, and so far, it's only for my own enjoyment and to highlight code the way I like to.
